# hw3_evo_computing
Sorry we are in the woods of NH, the only thing we would have changed is writing a module for the constants in sorting.py, Tahmid Washy and Eric Shi
Files 
- sorting.py: create all agents and objectives, constants should be imported from a module but we have no wifi :(
- evo.py: the class for evo computing
- test1.csv: the data we used for unit test
- final_solutions.csv: the csv for the final solutions for our computing
- favorite_solutions.csv: our best solution
